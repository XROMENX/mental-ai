## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set a strong `SECRET_KEY`. The backend will
raise an error if this variable is missing.

### Backend

Each API domain now runs as its own FastAPI service, including a dedicated IDP service for issuing JWTs. Start the ones you need:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd backend
uvicorn services.idp_service:app --reload --port 8000  # IDP service issuing JWTs
uvicorn services.auth_service:app --reload --port 8001
uvicorn services.assessments_service:app --reload --port 8002
uvicorn services.trackers_service:app --reload --port 8003
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Docker Compose

Run all services together:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

Sample manifests are provided in `k8s/microservices.yaml` for running the
backend microservices on a Kubernetes cluster.

Build and push the backend image:

```bash
docker build -t mental-ai-backend .
```

Apply the resources:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/microservices.yaml
```

Each service exposes its own Swagger UI at `/docs` and the OpenAPI schema at
`/openapi.json`.

### Running Tests

Start the required FastAPI service in one terminal:

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn services.idp_service:app --reload --port 8000  # IDP service issuing JWTs
uvicorn services.auth_service:app --reload --port 8001
```

In another terminal, run the integration tests:

```bash
python backend_test.py
```

Alternatively, run the helper script to start the server, run the tests and stop the server:

```bash
bash scripts/run_backend_tests.sh
```

If your server is running on a different host or port, set the
`API_BASE_URL` environment variable before running the tests:

```bash
API_BASE_URL=http://your-host:port python backend_test.py
```

Unit tests can still be executed directly with:

```bash
pytest --cov=backend tests
```

### Create Admin User (Optional)

For local testing you may want a predefined admin account. Run the helper script:

```bash
python scripts/create_admin_user.py
```

You can override the defaults using `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables.
